        <br> Before Dacc <br><br> 
    I have very limited Computer projects because before I attended DACC I didnt really have a whole lot of skills as afr as coding and stuff. While im very limited with expirence I did make my own PC back in the day. I also was very into creating/playing games on my PC.
